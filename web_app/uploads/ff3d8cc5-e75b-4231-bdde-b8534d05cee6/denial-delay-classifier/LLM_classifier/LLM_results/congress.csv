   the most important bills for reducing global warming ,,0.0,0.0
"Over the next 5 or 10 years, we'd better make sure we use the oil and  natural gas we have available in this country if we want people to be  able to drive their cars, work their farms, keep their jobs, and pay  their bills. That is what we will be voting about Monday at 5:30.",,1.0,1.0
"It strikes me as hypocritical that those who complain most and  express the most fear about global climate change are, in general--but  not always--the same people who are against nuclear power. Many of  these people, I believe, unfortunately, are not rational on this  subject. People have referred to them as ``nuke kooks.'' But, whatever,  they are obsessed with blocking nuclear power.",,0.0,1.0
"The first bill was the McCain-Lieberman bill which would have set  CO2 limits on all utilities that emit at least 10,000 tons  of greenhouse gases per year. That was defeated October 30, 2003, by a  vote of 43 to 55. That was when I was all alone. Actually, everyone  thought eventually something was going to pass and they were all afraid  of the issue.",,0.0,1.0

"Now, we all wake up in the morning and begin our day taking energy  for granted. One of the first things we do, for example, is flick a  switch and a light comes on, plug in a hair dryer, or turn on the  toaster oven. In so many different ways, virtually everything we do  involves using energy. We get in our cars and drive to work, or we get  on a subway. In both cases, we are using energy. And no doubt about it,  we are using a lot of energy.",,0.0,0.0
"These four pollutants are the major cause of some of the most serious  environmental problems the nation faces, including acid rain, smog,  respiratory illness, mercury contamination, and global warming. If we  are going to improve air quality and reduce global warming, we must  curb the emissions from these power plants.",,0.0,0.0
We remember in February that he announced he would put up $50 million  of his own money--and then he did--and that he would raise another $50  million. It would be $100 million that he would put in campaigns for  incumbents who would agree to try to resurrect the global warming  issue--because it has died in the eyes of the American people--and try  to stop the pipeline.,,0.0,1.0
"Emissions trading not only advantages the U.S. business, but it would  provide developing countries with incentives to sign up to binding  legal commitments that most people believe are important in this  treaty. I would like to point out to my colleagues that, currently in  the negotiations, Europe is trying to create a bubble over Europe  itself, trying to create a separate agreement where Europe will be able  to have emissions trading among European countries, but we and others  would not be able to engage in that trading. The result would be that  you might have Belgium required to do a 10-percent reduction in 2010  for CO2 and CH4 and NOX. But at the  same time, Greece would be able to increase by 30 percent. Spain would  increase by 17 percent. Ireland would increase by 15 percent. Portugal  would be able to increase by 40 percent. This is because they are  trying to set up a structure where they can trade amongst each other  for emissions without us having that same capacity.",,0.0,1.0

"Today I am pleased and proud to join my colleagues to speak about  something I thought we had established in grade school but apparently  bears repeating; that is, the importance of science. It is troubling  that today in the 21st century, there is any doubt about the importance  of real, sound science in many facets of our lives. It is troubling  that we still need to defend science here on the Senate floor.",,0.0,0.0
"I will pause to note some good news, which is that, just recently,  The Guardian announced that it will no longer accept advertising that  props up fossil fuels like oil and coal. The Guardian urged its  colleagues in the media to do the same. Acting chief executive Anna  Bateson and chief revenue officer Hamish Nicklin said in a statement:  ``Our decision is based on the decades-long efforts by many in that  industry to prevent meaningful climate action by governments around the  world.''",,0.0,0.0
"Instead of helping Americans move forward to these new technologies,  technologies that we have today, fuel-efficient cars we have today, the  energy bill we will consider Wednesday will go backwards to give the  subsidies to these old industries that started to reach fruition in the  late 1800s. That is most unfortunate.",,0.0,0.0
"There are now over 100 cities around the country which have committed  to clean or renewable energy. Four States and the District of Columbia  have policies that will get them to net zero emissions by mid-century.  Several more are moving in that direction. In my home State,  Minnesota's Governor, Tim Walz, has a plan for 100 percent carbon-free  electricity by 2050. That bill passed the Minnesota House by a 74-to-59  vote. Minnesota Senate, it is now your turn. To my colleagues in the  Senate, it is our turn as well.",,0.0,0.0

"That is not good for the lakes, the people, and species of this  region. Ice cover protects the lakes from evaporation, and it protects  the eggs of fall-spawning fish from winter weather. Coastal areas  unprotected by shore ice are more susceptible to erosion. Less ice  means less snowmobiling or ice fishing. As anyone in Cleveland or  Buffalo can tell you, open water fuels the dread lake-effect snows that  wallop leeward shores. All of this can be traced, in part, to climate  change driven by greenhouse gases.",,0.0,0.0
"They also said they weren't responsible for having to be able to run  through the actual effects on climate change, they just said it is  happening and so we need to do something. In fact, it has been  interesting for me to hear so many of my colleagues in the past 24  hours say: Republicans, put out your plan. We are doing something. You  need to put out a plan to show you are doing something as well.",,0.0,1.0
"Just by way of comparison, a nuclear powerplant such as the Tennessee  Valley Authority's Sequoayah nuclear plant would produce about the same  amount of energy as the windmills, which a renewable portfolio standard  and the tax subsidy would build in Tennessee. The electricity would be  available even when the wind was not blowing. So while we are debating  the wisdom of wind policies over the next several weeks, these massive  turbines are being built across America, 6,700 of them so far, 29 of  them in Tennessee.",,0.0,1.0
"Well, I have to say that is an argument I find insulting to America.  I don't want to wait for China to take the lead on anything because  they do not share our values. We don't wait for China to act on issues  such as human rights before we protect human rights. We don't wait for  China in terms of the way they treat their workers. We have read about  that. We don't wait for China, especially on environmental issues. We  have to act. China is not a role model. We should be the role model.",,0.0,0.0
"The most valuable contribution U.S. scientists can make is  to continually question basic assumptions and conclusions,  promote clear and careful appraisal and presentation of the  uncertainties about climate change as well as those areas in  which science is leading to robust conclusions, and work  toward a significant improvement in the ability to project  the future. In the process, we will better define the nature  of the problems and ensure that the best possible information  is available for policy makers.",,0.0,0.0
"I have to say that as a Pennsylvanian, I think I have an obligation  to not only speak about these issues but to fight on behalf of policies  that will advance the knowledge and mission of the EPA but will be  consistent with the directive I am obligated to follow in my State's  constitution. In Pennsylvania, if you go back to the founding of  Pennsylvania forward, we had many generations, especially through the  beginning of the Industrial Revolution, throughout most of the 1800s  and into the 1900s, until about the midcentury point, where we didn't  do a very good job of protecting our air and water and human health  because we let one or another industry pretty much do whatever they  wanted until the modern era. Fortunately, since that time, Pennsylvania  has made a lot of progress. One of the measures of that progress and  something I am bound by is a provision of the State's constitution,  article I, section 27, that says people shall ``have a right to clean  air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic,  historic, and esthetic values of the environment.''",,0.0,0.0

We know how to do a great many things that we are not doing. But this  should not be about doing things that we already know how to do. This  should be about the scientific breakthroughs to help us within 5 years  get firmly on a path to clean energy independence.,,0.0,0.0
"What part of human activity creates carbon dioxide? If carbon dioxide  is a negligible gas and it's only 3 percent of Earth's atmosphere, what  part is human activity? Human activity contributes perhaps 3 percent of  the 3 percent. In other words, human activity is maybe 3 percent  contributing to the 3 percent of carbon dioxide that's in Earth's  atmosphere. It's so negligible; it's a fraction of a fraction of a  percent. It can hardly be quantified.",,2.0,2.0
"And we intend to raise it to 35 miles a gallon, which is certainly  obtainable, and I'll talk about why we know it's obtainable in a few  minutes. We know that's a very obtainable goal, and we hope to pass  that. And this is why this is important. I did a little research on  this; I've done a lot of research on this. I actually just recently  wrote a book about this, so this is where I got a lot of this  information. When you write a book about things, you tend to go out and  ask a lot of people questions. And what I learned was that if we had  simply continued making the same improvements in mileage that we made  from 1976 to 1983, if we had simply continued on that rate of  improvement, we would be free of Saudi Arabian oil today. Think of what  that would have meant to our national security if we were free of that  oil influence in our foreign policy. Well, we have to get back in that  good habit of expecting more fuel efficient cars.",,0.0,0.0
"Oil is about $100 a barrel. We're in a recession. The United States,  just a couple of years ago, used 22 million barrels of oil a day. Now  we're using less than 19 million barrels of oil a day, and still oil is  $100 a barrel in the middle of a recession. We are also producing more  oil in our country than we did last year for the first time since 1970.  The production of oil has increased this last year. Every year before  that, the production of oil was lower than it was the preceding year.  Now, with Bakken oil, we're producing a bit more than we did last year.",,0.0,0.0
"Okay. Let's hear the science. Come on. I just had a science. I've had  five or six points now. Why is everyone afraid to take on these  scientific answers? If indeed CO2 causes it to warm, well,  then how come, when we had massive increases in CO2 in the  forties, fifties, sixties and seventies that it got cooler and not  warmer? Well, the calculations on global warming have been based on  fraudulent numbers.",,2.0,2.0

"Now, ladies and gentlemen, this amendment, contrary to its patron's  assertions, does not shield small businesses or farms, because it does  not block the avalanche of additional greenhouse gas rules that come  under various clean air programs. The EPA's greenhouse gas regulations  will drive up the prices of gasoline, electricity, food, goods and  services; and the cost of these regulations will be passed on to  everyone, including to small businesses.",,1.0,1.0
"But that doesn't seem to deter our Democratic colleagues from moving  full steam ahead on legislation that would drive these costs even  higher. After spending nearly $2 billion earlier this year on a party- line vote, our colleagues are back for round 2, and this time they are  prepared to take a wrecking ball to one of our crown jewels in this  country, which is our energy sector. By drowning the energy sector in  tax hikes or in increased regulations and costs, our Democratic  colleagues think that they can achieve their green   energy dreams with no consequences, but, of course, that is just a  dangerous fantasy.",,1.0,1.0
