"During the past few weeks, a series of articles in the press have implied that Willie Soon, a well-known global-warming skeptic, had violated ethical standards by failing to disclose information about research funding.",0
"The University of Colorados Sea Level Research Group decided in May to add 0.3 millimeters -- or about the thickness of a fingernail -- every year to its actual measurements of sea levels, sparking criticism from experts who called it an attempt to exaggerate the effects of global warming.",0
"Fears about global warming's impact on polar bears even spurred the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to list the bear as ""threatened"" under the Endangered Species Act in 2008 the first species to be listed over possibly being harmed in the future from global warming.",2
"So other than sunlight, wind, and rainbows ... just what is sustainable development supposed to be built of? Cell phones are one of the most revolutionary tools of development ... but we are depriving future generations of nickel and cadmium in doing so. Thats not sustainable.",0
"Ethanol and Air Pollution. Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claims a net decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from using ethanol, they recognize that ethanol use is a problem for conventional air pollutants. Ethanol use, according to the EPA, will increase the emission of chemicals that lead to the production of ozone, one of the nation's most challenging local air pollutants.",0

Villagers fight plans for huge 'eco towns',0
Sounds like the some critics are 100% correct.,0
"A new paper finds that over the past decade the global average effective cloud height has declined and that If sustained, such a decrease would indicate a significant measure of negative cloud feedback to global warming.",2
"Animation 1 provides the sea surface height anomalies and the depth-averaged temperature anomalies for the top 300 meters (T300) side by side. Again, please click on the animations to enlarge them.",0
"Our guess is that this is the real political purpose behind the wave of new drilling rules. The Administration has made coal its main fossil-fuel target, but the green lobby also has natural gas in its sights. A frontal assault is too politically risky, which is why regulatory attrition is the preferred approach.",0
"While science can inform policymakers, it can't determine policy. Policymakers must do cost/benefit analysis, taking into account tradeoffs, such as balancing risks from climate change against those from poverty, and as Hans von Storch points out, ""judgments of the value of costs versus benefits is a highly subjective, value-laden calculation.""",0

"President Obama seems to get this, sort of: ""Indeed, our failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. And that includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona.""",0
"""We suggest that the qualitative projections for dramatic reductions in population numbers and range are overly pessimistic given the response of polar bears, climate, and sea ice to the present,"" Canadian scientists wrote.",0
"In this hyper-partisan environment, it is good to know that a majority of Senators can still agree on an issue. When such a rare moment happens, the rest of us should pay attention, as it is probably something very important.",0

"This is confirmed by the annual Atlantic Ocean Sea Level data. Refer to Figure 8. Atlantic Ocean Sea Levels remained relatively flat in 2006, then dropped in 2007. http://i34.tinypic.com/m7b994.jpg Figure 8",2
"Clearly, your humble correspondent can't compete with Tommaso Dorigo in the number of rumors he propagates. Dorigo has already spread rumors by/from most of the janitors at CERN and Fermilab, too. :-) Many of his rumors will refer to indefensible interpretations of the observations. If one of them were right, it would still be amazing. However, I can imagine that both of the rumors described above will actually turn out to be right simultaneously.",0
"Quoting an essay in the American Outlook (Summer 2000), he noted, ""But to the Federal government, the greatest threat is something far different. As Warren Christopher assured his audience in May 1996 at Stanford University, the main threat is climate change produced by the burning of fuels .""",0

"To stay warm, thousands of elderly are using travel passes to ride buses all day, while others seek refuge in libraries and shopping centers, the Sunday Express noted. Others are ""putting their health at risk, in an attempt to keep costs down,"" by bundling up and turning the heat down or off entirely, said Age UK Charity Director Michelle Mitchell.",0
"Its announced goal of imposing global limits on greenhouse gas emissions will not be mandatory and ?President Obama has effectively gutted any meaningful agreement among the major industrialized nations, by having granted to the planet?s largest CO2 producer, China, free license to build as many coal power plants as they wish, and emit as many gigatons of greenhouse gases as they wish until 2030.?",0

"What the older statistical methods and the strict reliance on hard data and fancy mathematics have done is to create a system where there is too much certainty when making conclusions about complex events. We should all, always, take any result and realize that they are conditional on everything being just so. We should realize those just so conditions that obtained in the past might not in the future.",0

This idea was introduced by the previous Labour government and is already widespread in Europe.,0
"CRU still wants scientists to trust its conclusions on which even more climatology is based although it now admits that during an office move, it discarded computer tapes and paper records containing years of original weather-station observations. This is like telling an IRS auditor, Just read my tax return; I chucked my receipts. Proper science relies on generating reproducible results. Since these climate data now likely are locked in a landfill, CRUs results are, by definition, irreproducible. This means, ipso facto , they are non-scientific.",2
"Its clear that the world was warmer during medieval times. Marked on the map are study after study (all peer-reviewed) from all around the world with results of temperatures from the medieval time compared to today. These use ice cores, stalagmites, sediments, and isotopes. They agree with 6,144 boreholes around the world which found that temperatures were about 0.5C warmer world wide.",2
"Use more technology (geoengineering, carbon capture and storage).",0
"3) The carbon-dioxide issue is not about the United States anymore. Sure, the U.S. is the world's second-largest energy consumer. But over the past decade, carbon-dioxide emissions in the U.S. fell by 1.7%. And according to the International Energy Agency, the U.S. is now cutting carbon emissions faster than Europe, even though the European Union has instituted an elaborate carbon-trading/pricing scheme. Why? The U.S. is producing vast quantities of cheap natural gas from shale, which is displacing higher-carbon coal.",0
"Most outrageous of all, though, was how ill-prepared the region was for another major storm and how many political decisions had virtually ensured that any repeat of the 1893, 1938, 1944 and other storms would bring devastation far worse than would likely have occurred in the absence of those decisions.",0

"Furthermore, technological advancements have significantly increased the amount of recoverable natural gas in the United States. The estimated 2,200 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas in the U.S. is equivalent to 84 years of consumption at current rates.",1
"My ostracism from the IPCC advocacy tribe has been noted by other scientists that are quietly sympathetic to my position. As an example, several years ago at a conference, one of the speakers was quite critical of one piece of the conventional IPCC wisdom, but prefaced the talk with the statement something like this: While my talk contains some evidence that challenges some of the findings of the IPCC, I want to state up front that I support the IPCC consensus on climate change. After the talk, I asked this scientist why he felt the need to preface his talk with a statement of IPCC allegiance, when his research was rather devastating to part of the IPCCs argument. He stated I dont want to have to put up with what you have had to, so I make it very clear that I support the IPCC consensus.",2
