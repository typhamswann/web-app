with regard to natural gas. Governor Bush's energy plan is more than 
just increasing the domestic supply of oil. He would also expand access 
to natural gas on Federal lands and build more gas pipeline. Even the 
Vice President has said natural gas is vital for home heating and 
electricity and fuel for the future. Mr. President, 50 percent of U.S. 
homes, or 56 million homes, use natural gas for heating. It provides 15 
percent of the Nation's electric power; and 95 percent of our new 
electric power plants will be powered by natural gas as a fuel, 
partially of choice but partially of necessity. You cannot build a 
coal-fired plant; you cannot build a nuclear plant; you cannot build a 
new hydroelectric plant. Where are you going to go? You are going to go 
to natural gas. You can get a permit. But all the emphasis of the 
electric industry is towards natural gas. Putting on more pressure 
increases the prices, as I said, from $2.16 a year ago to just over 
$4.50 today. The ratepayers are going to be paying this. They just have 
not seen it yet. It has not been included in your electric bills, but

this chart, I think, demonstrates why the United States was trying to 
insist that sinks be a consideration in emissions. As we see by this


chart, this is North America, and the red indicates the amount of CO2 
emissions. The blue at the bottom displays the sequestration, or the 
sinks, how much of the CO2 we capture by our corn and our sorghum and 
our field crops and our woodlands. And when we compare that with Europe
