"EPA's narrow interpretation of the RMR&R; exclusion is discouraging investments in efficiency improvements by utilities, even though such improvements are closely linked to lower emissions and are encouraged by other federal and state environmental programs. The type of modification to electric generators proposed by Detroit Edison, for example, would reduce the amount of coal needed to generate the same level of power by about 112,000 tons per year.24 Detroit Edison estimates 1,000 other electric utility units in the U.S. could similarly replace their turbine blades, reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 81 million tons per year.",0_0
"A second possibility is a long-term decrease in middle and upper tropospheric humidity, and no increase in convective mixing. In this case, daytime mixing would bring down the lower humidity air to the surface from the same altitude as before. There is some radiosonde evidence for such a decrease in absolute humidities above the turbulent boundary layer (e.g. Paltridge, 2009 ). If real, such a decrease might well result in negative water vapor feedback, since a small decrease in mid- and upper tropospheric humidity can have a natural radiative cooling effect which outweighs the warming from a larger increase in lower tropospheric humidity (e.g. Spencer and Braswell, 1997 ; Miskolczi, 2010 ). Of course, all climate models exhibit strongly positive water vapor feedback, approximately doubling the direct warming effect of increasing CO2 alone.",3_1

"Nature absorbs 98.5% of the CO 2 that is emitted by nature and man. As CO 2 increases in the atmosphere, nature causes plant growth to increase via photosynthesis which is an endothermic (cooling) reaction. For every pound of biomass formed some 10,000 Btu are removed from the atmosphere. CO 2 is absorbed, and oxygen is liberated. Further, a doubling of CO 2 will increase the photosynthesis rate by 30 to 100%, depending on temperature and available moisture 8 . More CO 2 is absorbed by the plants due to the increased concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere available for conversion to carbohydrates. Nature therefore has in place a built-in mechanism to regulate the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere that will always completely dwarf man's feeble attempts to regulate it. Further, no regulation is necessary because CO 2 is not a pollutant; it is part of the animal-plant life cycle. Without it, life would not exist on earth.",3_3

"Abstract. The recent slowdown in global warming has brought into question the reliability of climate model projections of future temperature change and has led to a vigorous debate over whether this slowdown is the result of naturally occurring, internal variability or forcing external to Earths climate system. To address these issues, we applied a semi-empirical approach that combines climate observations and model simulations to estimate Atlantic- and Pacific-based internal multidecadal variability (termed AMO and PMO, respectively). Using this method, the AMO and PMO are found to explain a large proportion of internal variability in Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures. Competition between a modest positive peak in the AMO and a substantially negative-trending PMO are seen to produce a slowdown or false pause in warming of the past decade.",5_1

"Super-elevated CO 2 enhanced total dry weight of plantlets by more than 2-fold, when compared to dry weights of plantlets grown at ambient CO 2 . Interestingly, atmospheric CO 2 enrichment not only significantly increased the growth of existing roots, it also increased the induction of new roots from internodes located on orchid stems. Total chlorophyll content was increased by elevated CO 2 in young leaves and roots by 64 and 118%, respectively, thus permitting greater light harvesting during the process of photosynthesis. Greater utilization of sunlight in CO 2 -enriched plantlets likely contributed to tissue starch contents that were nearly 20-fold higher than those measured in control plantlets. In spite of this large accumulation of starch, no disruption or damage of chloroplasts was evident in leaves and roots of CO 2 -enriched plantlets. What it means",3_3

"As has been shown time after time, the private market, when allowed to function, works much better than an overregulated industry. Moving the state into the middle of the electric market will only create a host of new problems. The state cannot build power plants faster, cheaper, or more efficiently than the private sector. The state cannot set prices better than the private sector. The state can, however, spend the taxpayer's money faster than the taxpayer could. Other states, such as Pennsylvania, and other countriesEngland, for examplehave made a success of electrical deregulation. California could too.

Yet, the rate of both surface and deep ocean warming since the 1950s, after accounting for natural El Nino and La Nina fluctuations, suggests no cause for alarm.",0_0
"Something strange is happening to the north Pacific. It is setting sea temperature records, scrambling weather patterns, damaging ecosystems, and nudging up the global temperature. The scientists who have observed it call it after what it looks like on temperature maps of the Pacific behold the blob. The warmth of 2015 so far and the expectation that it will get even warmer has already given rise to headlines that the pause has ended and that global warming has resumed. However one does not follow from the other. The blob and the El Nino are weather events not climate, natural fluctuations and not long-term trends. Their contribution to world temperature does not represent a resumption of long term anthropogenic warming in the same way that the cool year of 2007 did not represent the onset of a rapid decline in global temperature. --David Whitehouse, Global Warming Policy Forum, 6 September 2015",1_4
"The difference between the two measurement sets may indicate a real albedo difference betweeen the two measurement periods, but part of it is undoubtedly due to calibration and algorithm differences.

"If we compare the HADCRUT4 data to the CMIP5 models (historic and RCP6.0) for the period of 1997 to 2012, Figure 1, we can see that the models over-estimate the warming from 65S to 65N (the vast majority of the planet) and underestimate the warming at the poles. Therefore, if the Cowtan and Way (2013) data are increasing the warming in the Arctic, they are creating a greater divergence from the models there, but failing to reduce the differences between the models and data where the models overestimate the warming.",5_1

"It begins with measures of the amount of energy entering the Earths atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) only consider changes in the irradiance portion of incoming solar energy (insolation). They claim that, up to 1950, it explained over 50 percent of temperature variation; then, CO2 became 90 percent of the cause of change. Part of the reason for downplaying irradiance is the low percentage of change in modern records. The earliest record from outside the atmosphere from a manned observatory was Skylab (19731979). Skylab showed a change of 0.14% in the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). An average over time shows a variation of 0.1% for an 11 year sunspot cycle. This seems like a very small number, and therefore of little consequence.

The selected period was AugustOctober 1997. Model simulations with coarse grid increment produced a weak signal in the precipitation pattern and the synoptic scale circulation over Europe, implying a damping of the North Atlantic atmospheric response to the tropical Pacific SST perturbation. Fine resolution experiments suggested an amplified dynamic response providing a direct link between tropical Pacific SST and North Atlantic synoptic circulation.

This is a hugely important distinction, and one the public and policymakers have been misled on by the IPCC.",0_0

A quick check of the assumed conditions at the proposed onset of the Younger Dryas (12900-12800 YBP) shows that at this time Lake Chicago existed as a melt lake with an outlet near Chicago and covered the southernmost tip of the current Lake Michigan. At this time, just north of Lake Chicago, the Michigan Lobe of the Wisconsin Glaciation was in rapid retreat. There is no reason to dismiss the likelihood that the edge of the ice sheet may have lain to the south of the Southern Chippewa Basin (SCB), the location of the anomalous terrain.

Some of that unrest will be among the Russian Muslim population, who are overwhelmingly Sunni and who are not pleased at Russian participation in a sectarian war on the Shi'a side. Supporting Assad and Iran also weakens Russia's hopes for outreach to the Sunni Arabs, whose help Russia will need to jack the oil price back up. Given all that, negotiating with Russia over Syria looks like a smart play, and this is where, over and over, the Obama Administration comes out when it debates Syria policy.",0_0

"A new study very well worth reading by Ermolli et al. (2013) looks at the influence of the spectral variation of solar radiation (SSI), especially the ultraviolet spectrum: It is fluctuating much more strongly, by up to 10% between a quiet and an active sun. And at low solar activity, it generates precisely the pattern in the wintertime that weve been seeing since 2006: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which impacts the temperature in the Eurasian region especially in the wintertime, is controlled and effected by the UV radiation of the sun. When there is less solar activity, it gets colder in the region. This is precisely what we are observing, and the large part of the deviation observed in the pure GHG models stems precisely from that. Shouldnt this be a wake-up call for the climate scientists to look more closely at SSI? This should have been done long ago. However, that would have meant conceding that CO2 is not everything.",2_1

Meanwhile the Stern Review estimates the cost of carbon mitigation to total 2 percent of world GDP by the year 2100.

In a double whammy the water chemistry of the reef may become more acidic from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. This threatens the corals ability to secrete exoskeletons and grow. Can corals learn to adapt to these new conditions? Certainly experience on other reef systems suggests that coral can expel heat sensitive algae and replace them with heat tolerant strains. But how many species can do this is unknown. Unfortunately a certain amount of warming of the oceans,3_2

The failure to use income after taxes and transfers cannot be accidental. It seems to be a deliberate attempt to mislead the public. And it is not the only misuse of data. Much of the recent large rise in the income received by the top 1 or 10 percent results from the Federal Reserve's policy of lowering interest rates and raising housing and stock prices. Higher stock prices increase the incomes of those who own shares. Middle-income earners do not have large stock or bond portfolios. Their shares are mainly part of corporate pension plans. The rise in stock prices benefits the middle class by increasing the support for their future pensions. But the gain is part of their wealth and not part of their current income. So the rise in stock prices widens the spread in the income distribution and contributes to the clamor. That's measurement with little or no substantive effect.,0_0

"Scientific understanding about the Earth??s climate is tentative at best. As a result of uncertainties over what causes climate to change and how and when, there are rival theories and arguments among scientists about how to interpret the evidence.Rather than join these arguments, we have examined the processes that have been used to analyze the available data in order to derive forecasts of climate over the 21st Century. We have concluded that the forecasting process reported on by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lacks a scientific basis.",5_1
