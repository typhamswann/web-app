20th century. For example, much of the CO2, much of the 
carbon dioxide, emitted during the Second World War is still with us 
today, and, with each passing year, the concentration is projected to 
grow to ever-higher levels. So, even if it were possible to stop

specific issues including relations with Russia, energy security,

begun to implement an increasingly assertive security policy including 
efforts to intimidate neighboring states, through the threat of force. 
There was also concern expressed that Russia would continue to use its 
energy supplies as a political lever to influence European policy. It 
was clear from our meetings that not only the United States and NATO, 
but the European Union as well, are concerned about Moscow's posture on 
a variety of issues. And, while there were differences of opinion over 
how to structure future relations between NATO and Russia and the NATO 
PA and the Russian delegates to the Assembly, most felt that dialogue 
between NATO, the NATO PA, and Russia was important and should 
continue. Many delegates welcomed the U.S. commitment to a new, 
constructive relationship with Moscow and expressed hope that through 
those promising relations, Russia's attitude toward NATO could become 
more positive. On Afghanistan, there was continued support for the ISAF 
mission among the allies and a willingness to provide the additional 
civilian and financial support necessary for the reconstruction effort 
there. However, we did detect an undercurrent of concern among some

conversation about drilling in the Arctic. The Arctic, because it is so 
cold and frozen and full of ice, has been a terrain, particularly 
offshore, where drilling is extraordinarily difficult, with extreme 
risk of oilspill. Should an oilspill occur in very cold water, that 
means the damage will be enormous because the oil will break down so 
slowly. So I put forward a keep-it-in-the-ground bill for no offshore 
drilling in the Arctic. And that is not the bill we have had action on 
here in the Senate, but, as it turns out, we have moved forward. Shell, 
which was the leading company to explore offshore in the Arctic, sent 
ships up for several years. They had one calamity after another, one 
disaster after another because of the harsh and challenging 
circumstances. Citizens in the United States, in a grassroots movement, 
said: Shell, no. Shell, no. This is wrong. This is the height of 
irresponsibility to our environment and to have the U.S. leading 
extraction in a whole new area. We should be leading the Arctic nations 
and leaving the Arctic off limits as part of this ``Keep It in the 
Ground'' movement, not leading the front edge of extraction.

step toward the implementation of such a cap and trade system to 
address global climate change. If severe emissions reduction 
requirements in a cap and trade system take effect before the carbon 
capture and storage technologies are available, the effect on coal 
fired utilities in particular would be severe. They would rapidly 
switch from coal to other fuels. Such fuel switching would 
significantly increase electricity prices to the severe detriment of 
both residential and industrial electricity consumers. Fuel switching 
from coal would most likely result in far greater uses of natural gas 
for electricity generation, severely stressing an already constrained 
natural gas supply and dramatically increasing natural gas prices.

6 to 10 percent. If we must keep it in the ground; that is, keep our 
fossil fuels--80 percent of them--in the ground, then isn't it 
counterproductive to do new leases, leases that will extend production 
not 10 or 15 years but 20 or 30 years on gas and 40 or 50 years on 
coal, into the future? We lock in extraction and burning of fossil

That is Texas. I am a supporter of environmentally safe development of 
our oil and gas reserves. In fact, I offered an amendment that was 
accepted to provide for the enhanced development of energy resources in 
the gulf as it has been done in an environmentally safe manner. There
